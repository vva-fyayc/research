* Despite the low community size for Chakra UI it is really active and respond fast to questions and with helpful suggestions to problems.
* Chakra UI adds smaller number of classes to itâ€™s components when styling them compared to Material UIs many classes which makes it easier to debug and change the right class when styling or overriding.
